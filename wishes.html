                    <p>Anuja, you are the cutest macha I've found.I feel like our relationship has so many feelings,making fun of each other, making fun of others, creating stories and laughing most of the time.At the same  time, we share our sorrows.We sometimes fight and are annoyed of each other.But one thing I can say with certainty is, feelings tend to change with time, the friendship and love we share will last forever.As an elder person or a friend, I bless u "Chiranjeeva Chiranjeeva Sukhebhava Sukhebhava", means "live longer and be happy forever".

                    <p> Happy Birthday Anuja!! It feels so weird to type your full name,hehe. Happy birthday you pretty, funny, kind, super sweet human! If I had to guess someone from the 100 or so people present on the first day of our training, you would definitely not be in the top ten people I would’ve guessed to become one of my best friends ever. You were so different from me, an outright extrovert compared to the closet- extrovert that I am. But here we are, it has been over 6 months since I quit my job there and you are one of the best people I met there. You know how special you are to me already, so I won’t be telling anything new today. I will just say , Thank you. Thank you for all the laughs,thank you for all the new friends I made because of you, thank you for calling me every single week, thank you for texting me every single day during this lockdown to make sure I am okay, thank you for sending me chocolates on my birthday even when I am thousands of kilometers away from you, thank you for all the love. 2019 was the best year of my life and you were one of the main reasons why. I don’t know what else to say.As cheesy as this sounds, just keep spreading joy like you always do:)</p>
